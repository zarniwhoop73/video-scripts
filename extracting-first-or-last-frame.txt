 I wanted to try extracting the last frame from what would be the final clip,
e.g. to add a caption saying "The End".  The following command does not exactly
do that - if I've got it right, it averages the last half second.

 This was a .mov frame : according to ffprobe, every frame is a keyframe
(unlike x264 where keyframes seem to only be on every 250th frame).  I think
that ffmpeg's  -ss setting ought to be reliable in this situation.

 First I ran video-summary.sh and determined that the file length was 39.5s.

 Then I ran:
ffmpeg -i filename -r 1/2 -ss 0:00:39.0 -t 0:00:00.5 -f image2 end%05d.png

 That created exactly one file, end00001.png. By using ffprobe I had determined
that every video frame in a .mov file is a keyframe, so -ss ought to work
reliably here - in x264 video, only every 250th frame seems to be a key frame.

 After that, edit the png in the gimp to add the required text, and then use
video-caption.sh to create the mkv.

 Similar commands can also be used at the start of a clip, to extract the
beginning.  I have also played with the rate setting, to get a shorter period
in the png, and ended up with 3 pngs which was not what I had intended.  At
least the %Nd part of the name covers that.
